The structure of linux commands

username @ nameofcomputer : path user

On your device there will not be spaces but i added them for more clarity.

*Tips on paths*
To break it down further you can think of paths like nesting dolls. 
To get to a file on why ducks are cool, we may need to go to the documents directory.
Or if you are a bird enthusiast perhaps there is an entire directory dedicated to it!

on windows this may look like "C:\Users\ChaosQuery\Documents\whyducksarecool.txt"
